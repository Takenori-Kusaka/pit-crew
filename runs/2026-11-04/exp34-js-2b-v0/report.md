# pit-wall report: jobsel

- runner: harbor / model: claude-sonnet-5-5 / runs: 10 (scored: 9) / 2026-11-03T22:39:25.670Z
- **1 run(s) are invalid and excluded from every score.** See "Run validity". Do not read the verdicts below until they are rerun.
- **behavior** = the discipline itself, fair to every arm. **protocol** = this harness's own channel (e.g. a specific label); vanilla cannot know it.
- Δ intervals: 95% from Jeffreys Beta posteriors of each case/arm pass rate, case-averaged. **inconclusive** = the interval includes 0.
